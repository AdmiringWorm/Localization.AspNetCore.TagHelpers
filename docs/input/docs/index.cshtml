<p>
  This user guide, like Localization.AspNetCore.TagHelpers itself, is under very active development.
  Some parts of it aren't documented as completely as they need to be, but we gladly accept your contributions.
</p>

<p>
  We need your help to improve the documentation for Localization.AspNetCore.TagHelpers, so if there is something that you
  would like to add then you can edit the content directly on GitHub.

    <a href="@Context.GetLink(child)">

    </a>
  </h1>

  if (child.ContainsKey(DocsKeys.Description))
  {
    <p>@Html.Raw(child.String(DocsKeys.Description))</p>
  }

  @Html.Partial("_ChildPages", child)
}
