# Usage
The most basic and simplest use of this tag helper is with the following:
```html
<span localize>
  Whatever text you want to localize here.
</span>
```

This tag helper also provides exactly the same attributes as the Localize element tag helper.
Please see [Localize content using a tag](content-tag-localization) for possible attributes.
